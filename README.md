# Introduction
This project aims to analyze customer reviews and ratings using SQL queries. By querying the data, we can extract valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sentiment analysis.
1. **Find the average rating of each product.**
2. **Retrieve customer data who gave a rating higher than 4.**
3. **Count the number of times each customer wrote a review.**
4. **Find the average rating for each day of the week.**
5. **Find which products have a rating equal to or greater than 3.5.**
6. **Count the number of negative reviews.**
7. **Find which customers wrote positive reviews (reviews containing the words "excellent", "impressive", or "recommend") and gave a high rating (rating equal to or greater than 4).**
8. **On average, how many words does each customer use in their reviews?**
